# Hotel-Revenue-Analysis-Star-Schema
Hotel Revenue Analysis (2018-2020) - Milestone 1Internship Project: Data Modeling & Dimensional ArchitectureStatus: Milestone 1 Completed | Milestone 2 Pending📌 Project OverviewThis project involves analyzing historical hotel booking data across three years (2018-2020) to extract meaningful business insights. The focus of Milestone 1 was to transform raw, disconnected Excel datasets into a high-performance Star Schema within Power BI.🏗️ Data Architecture (Star Schema)To ensure scalability and efficient filtering, I moved away from a "flat file" structure to a relational Star Schema.Fact Table: Raw_fact (Centralized booking transactions and financial metrics).Dimension Tables: * Dim_Hotel: Hotel categories (Resort vs. City).Dim_Date: Temporal attributes for time-series analysis.Dim_Room: Room type classifications.Dim_Customer: Aggregated guest demographics.🛠️ ETL & Transformation StepsThe following steps were performed in Power Query (M Language) to prepare the data:Data Consolidation: Appended three separate yearly tables (2018, 2019, 2020) into a unified master dataset.Data Cleaning: Handled nulls and errors in the children column, replacing them with 0.Key Engineering:Date Key: Created a numeric key using the formula:$$Date.Year([Date]) \times 10000 + Date.Month([Date]) \times 100 + Date.Day([Date])$$Mapping: Implemented conditional logic for Meal Costs and Market Segment Discounts based on organizational pricing tables.Customer Integration: Performed a multi-column join (Adults, Children, Babies, Country) to link a unique customer_id from the dimension table back to the fact table.
